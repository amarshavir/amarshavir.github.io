      <p>In a time before creation, there was darkness, with a light from which the universe and time truly began; shadows and anachronism emerged to balance the universe. When the God of the stars and all that is good creates new majestic life, a soul is born into the abyss below. In the godless void, a wonders soul was created, a soul named Isayas.</p>
<p>Isayas was manifested in the year before our lord, thousand and ten. In the abyss, Isayas was unlike the ones before him and those after. He had drifted through the cosmos, searching for some sign of hope or salvation, but he had found only emptiness and darkness.</p>
<p>One day, as Isayas floated through the endless void, he saw a glimmer of light in the distance. It was faint at first, but it grew brighter and brighter as he approached until it became a dazzling beacon that filled the abyss with the wonderous light.</p>
<p>The man was drawn towards the light like a moth to a flame, and as he drew closer, he saw that it was a rising morning star, a celestial being of unimaginable beauty and power.</p>
<p>And from the morning star, a magnificent angel appeared, Iva, her fair skin glowing with an inner light. She was innocent yet understanding of the darkness surrounding her, and she reached out to Isayas gently when she saw him floating before her.</p>
<p>As Iva touched Isayas, the warmth of the heavens purged the cold darkness from him that day, and he knew that he had finally found the path to his salvation.</p>
<p>He followed the angel as she led him through the cosmos, guiding him toward a place where lost spirits could find peace and rest.
Together, the man and the angel travelled through the vastness of space, encountering all sorts of wonders and dangers along the way. But through it all, the angel remained by his side, guiding and protecting him, until they finally reached the gates of Heaven.</p>
<p>And there, in a place of beauty and light, the man found the peace he had been seeking for so long. He knew that he had been truly blessed, for he had seen not only a guide but a friend as well - one who had helped him to find his way home.</p>
<p>From that day on, they journeyed together, To find more lost souls, as God&rsquo;s gift to the abyss Is salvation. In Hebrew, the name Iva means &ldquo;God&rsquo;s gift,&rdquo; and so she was, to Isayas and all Who were lost in the darkness of the void.</p>
