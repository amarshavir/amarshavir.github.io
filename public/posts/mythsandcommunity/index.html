      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>When writing, I am between the ages of seventeen and eighteen. Within all scientific and social metrics, I am still very much in my development. That said, please do not dismiss what I say; my words are the construct of experiences from the men who have gone before me and me.</p>
<p>Before I begin my long-formatted rant, I would like to share some of my stories to give an idea of where I come from, Ideologically and politically. I was Born Robel Istephanos as a Wolatia Ethiopian. I was adopted by a family from the United States in a county with a low minority population. While being one of the few black people in school did not directly affect my education, the circumstance did not aid my mental health. I was raised under the cultural subtext of being white but with the systemic and societal expectation of being black. Under this pretense, I have hated who I am for most of my life. One of the most complicated challenges I wake up with is figuring out who I am. I will stand in this world as an outsider; I now find comfort in the isolation of a wandering mind. I am Amar Shavir.</p>
<h2 id="development">Development</h2>
<p>The development of any intelligent lifeform is heavily dependent on the parental element of that lifeform. Until recently, that aspect has been limited to providing the skills and knowledge for the species&rsquo; survival.
Across the animal kingdom, survival has been the only thing that life has equated to, but what happens when life and survival no longer mean the same thing? Humanity&rsquo;s technological development has pushed our first-world societies out of a constant fight for survival. With humanity&rsquo;s progression over roughly the past 200, what the parent provided ideologically, dare I say, matters more than the survival skills a parent could give its offspring. Provided you live in a first-world nation, even if you do not, the importance of the mind in every modern civilization has significantly exceeded that of the body.
What happens to all of the biological systems that humankind has developed throughout the millennia? What are they, and are those things now holding the world back from achieving a higher level of prosperity?</p>
<h2 id="myth">Myth</h2>
<p>Throughout history, Myths have been created to explain acts of nature that the current state of science could not. Interestingly enough, we still believe in myths in our advanced scientific society. Only in modern times are our myths not there to explain why the skies darken, go black, and roar with the sound of thunder because of the wrath of some almighty god-king. Instead, our myths are ones we tell ourselves, lies we tell ourselves to make us different from the heard, to give the illusion that we are somehow better than the people around us. One of the biggest myths is the concept of the self-made man.</p>
<p>Henry Clay, an American state representative of Kentucky in the Senate and House of Representatives, originally coined the term in 1842. Since then, it has been used to describe anyone who has worked to get to a position of power. Besides the literal sense that you physically cannot make yourself. Knowledge is required to get into a position of power or become successful. A man does not know how to read, write, speak, and do basic mathematics innately; all of those things are learned from the presence of teachers. And before those teachers, they were passed down from books written by other teachers. Without teachers, we fall; Without the people around us, without a community, we cannot rise to reach our full potential. Humans require the presence of others not only to survive but to become more than just an animal. Community is a requirement of human life.</p>
<h2 id="community">Community</h2>
<p>I have spent the better part of the summer of 2022 learning what a true community is and what a healthy community is. Community is helping fellow member to better their life because, in turn, it will favor you. Community is a cycle of giving and receiving. While a good community will not have expectations, being an active member is invaluable to gaining the most out of being a part of any particular community. I would define a proper community as a group of people that hold the same core values and give each member respect, time, and aid in the face of disaster.</p>
